    title: 'Sport Tones',
    content: ['This column is like a trip down memory lane for me and I appreciate your indulgence. Back in the 1960s when newspapers at every level still ruled the media world, I got a job at the Wilton Bulletin in Connecticut writing and editing the sports section of that weekly publication.', 'There was one high school in Wilton and there still in only one high school in Wilton so it\’s no surprise that the Warriors often grabbed the headlines.\n Since I owned my own barber back then and was open Tuesday through Saturday, I was able to cover to cover evening basketball and ice hockey but for Saturday football and weekday afternoon baseball, I\’d sneak out of the shop for a few hours, leaving a note on the door for my customers letting them know when I\’d be back. Not exactly the best business practice, but I managed to get away with it since most of my customers also read the Bulletin every week.', 'My first column, also called Sport Tones, was about high school basketball and in fact was written as an audition for the job. Had my boss Dave Gearhart not liked and approved that first column who knows where my sports career in print, radio and eventually television would\’ve gone.', 'I still have the Royal typewriter I used to knock out my weekly little league results, Biddy league football articles and everything from high school Lacrosse and Field hockey, Cross Country, track, football, baseball and softball. I was a one man show and it was a blast.', 'Perhaps that explains why I\’m calling this column Sport Tones as well.', 'As we move into September the local college football season has the state of Washington buzzing. In the aftermath of the bad news about the future of the Pac-12, both the WSU Cougars and UW Huskies have started their seasons at 2-0 and in fact eight of the Pac-12 schools are ranked in the top 25.', 'As I write this, the Mariners have just dropped three out of four in Tampa and finished a rough road trip winning only three of ten games. They\’re still in the hunt for the A.L. West title and a playoff spot but it\’s starting to look like their young pitchers are struggling as the season enters it\’s final 20 or so games. Mariner fans aren\’t the only ones wringing their hands either since the Seahawks dropped their opener to the L.A Rams 30-13 and the Rams were playing without their All-pro receiver Cooper Cupp.', 'Being a sports fan can be an emotional roller coaster. Add the heavy promotion of sports betting on all the networks and that roller coaster ride can become depressing and dangerous if the betting gets out of control.', 'So as I launch this new column, I\’ll try to keep you in good spirts to the best of my ability with stories that entertain and maybe even enlighten. Have a great week.']
